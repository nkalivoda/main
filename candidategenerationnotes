automatic candidate generation:
assumptions: 
	terminals are all words: 
		(workers helped)
		(workers mature helped)
		showed workers dog
**		showed chief of-workers dog **

	intermediate levels are phi
	root =  iota
	variable: phi-rootedness. That is: Is the tree rooted in a phi? (is there a phi that's coextensive with the iota?) i.e. do the intermediate levels form a singly-rooted tree?
	
	
generate candidates (represent with parentheses?) -> save the parenthesized candidates as strings
	generate a list of the candidate names for use in the tableau
translate candidates into JavaScript notation

... and then run makeTableau on the candidate set generated.
